Generate all permutations of a set

Example: (1,2,3)

(1) * (2,3)

(1) * ( (2,3), (3,2) )

(1,2) -> (1,2), (2,1)

Output:

(1, 2, 3), (1, 3, 2), (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 1), (3, 1, 2), (3, 2, 1)


recursion base
permutation of a single element is that element
if len(input) is one, we have to return that element as tuple of one

recursion body
# apply recursion call to left

for index i in all inputs

left would be a i-th element
right would be all other elements before i-th + after i-th

for all perm of right
result would be left + j perm from right


return result
